# State Management with React Query
### (packt-state-with-reactquery)

This is my code, written, while following along with a book titled ["State Management with React Query"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR3X7D8M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_351_o00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) by Daniel Afonso from Packt Publishing.

I will be creating branches for the Chapters instead of folders to test efficiency by comparison.

### Here is the current branch list:

[Chapter01 Branch](https://github.com/jreidell/packt-state-with-reactquery/tree/chapter01)
[Chapter02 Branch](https://github.com/jreidell/packt-state-with-reactquery/tree/chapter02)
